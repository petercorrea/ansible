# 1. Introduction to Ansible

#### What is Ansible?

- Ansible is an open-source automation tool, or platform, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and provisioning. It aims to provide large productivity gains to a wide variety of automation challenges.

#### Why Ansible?

- **Simple to Use**: It uses a simple syntax (YAML) for its playbooks.
- **Agentless**: There’s no need to install any agent software on the nodes it manages. It uses SSH for communication.
- **Powerful & Flexible**: Ansible has a vast collection of built-in modules, supporting a wide variety of tasks.
- **Efficient**: Because it’s agentless, it reduces the overhead on your network by preventing the need for a continuous connection to managed nodes.

#### Ansible Architecture

- **Control Node**: The machine where Ansible is installed and from which all tasks and playbooks are run.
- **Managed Nodes**: The servers (nodes) being managed by Ansible.
- **Inventory**: A list of nodes being managed by Ansible.

#### Playbook Architecture

- **Playbooks**: The primary configuration, deployment, and orchestration language of Ansible, they allow for the launch of tasks sequentially and selectionally against custom-defined data sets. Playbooks are YAML files that describe the desired state of your systems, which are used to guide Ansible's execution.
- **Play(s)**: A play is a collection of steps that are executed against selected hosts from your inventory. It is the primary block that makes up an Ansible playbook. Each play is designed to target a specific group of hosts and outline a series of tasks that should be applied to those hosts. Plays allow you to group tasks and apply them conditionally based on host or group characteristics.
- **Tasks**: A task is the smallest unit of action in Ansible. Tasks are used to define what action (module) should be executed on the targeted hosts. Each task calls an Ansible module, passing the specified options to that module. Tasks are executed in order, one at a time, against all hosts matched by the play, before moving on to the next task.
- **Modules**: The units of code Ansible executes. Ansible executes a module by sending it to all the nodes in the inventory.
- **Facts**: Information derived about the state of the systems.
- **Roles**: Organize playbooks into reusable files to manage aspects of system configuration.

```yaml

# This is a playbook with a single play
- name: Configure Web and Database Servers # Play name
  hosts: all # Target hosts
  become: yes # Use privilege escalation
  vars: # Variables applicable to this play
    http_port: 80
    max_clients: 200

  tasks: # List of tasks to be executed on the target hosts
    - name: Install Apache on Web Servers # Task 1
      ansible.builtin.yum: # Module
        name: httpd # Module option
        state: present # Module option
      when: "'webservers' in group_names" # Conditional execution based on group membership
      notify: # Triggers a handler if this task makes changes
        - Restart Apache # Handler name

    - name: Copy the Apache configuration file # Task 2
      ansible.builtin.copy: # Module
        src: /src/httpd.conf # Source file on control node
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf # Destination path on the managed node
      when: "'webservers' in group_names" # Conditional execution

    - name: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed on Database Servers # Task 3
      ansible.builtin.yum: # Module
        name: postgresql-server # Module option
        state: present # Module option
      when: "'dbservers' in group_names" # Conditional execution

  handlers: # Handlers are tasks that are called by other tasks
    - name: Restart Apache # Handler name
      ansible.builtin.service: # Module
        name: httpd # Service name
        state: restarted # Desired state
      listen: "Restart Apache" # The name this handler listens to

# End of playbook
```

**Explanation of the Components**:

**Play**: The entire document is a single play that targets all hosts (hosts: all). It contains variables, tasks, and handlers specific to configuring both web and database servers.

**Variables** (vars): Defined at the play level and are available to all tasks within this play. These variables set configuration parameters that tasks might use.

**Tasks**: Each task performs a specific operation, such as installing packages or copying files. Tasks use modules (ansible.builtin.yum, ansible.builtin.copy, ansible.builtin.service) to perform actions.

**Conditional Execution** (when): Some tasks are conditionally executed based on the group membership of the target hosts. This is determined using the when clause.

**Notify**: If the task that installs Apache makes changes, it notifies the handler named "Restart Apache" to restart the Apache service.

**Modules**: Each task calls a specific module, passing options to it. Modules are the units of code that Ansible executes. For example, ansible.builtin.yum is used to manage packages, ansible.builtin.copy to copy files, and ansible.builtin.service to manage services.

**Handlers**: Special tasks that run when notified by other tasks. In this example, the "Restart Apache" handler restarts the Apache service but only if it is notified (triggered) by a task.

### Getting Started

Before diving into practical examples, ensure Ansible is installed on your system. On most Linux distributions, you can install Ansible via the package manager.

For example, on Ubuntu-based systems, you can install Ansible with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

Verify the installation with:

```bash
ansible --version
```

This command should return the version of Ansible installed.

Next, let's create a simple inventory file to manage our nodes. Create a file named `hosts` with the following content:

```ini
[web]
server1.example.com

[db]
server2.example.com
```

This file defines two groups, `web` and `db`, each containing a server. Replace `server1.example.com` and `server2.example.com` with the hostnames or IP addresses of your servers.

You can now run an Ansible ad-hoc command to ping all servers in your inventory:

```bash
ansible all -i hosts -m ping
```

This command uses the `ping` module to check the connection to all hosts defined in the `hosts` file.
