### 8. Ansible for Network Automation

Ansible's simplicity and flexibility make it an ideal tool for managing not just servers but also network devices. Network automation with Ansible can simplify complex network tasks, ensure consistency across devices, and improve the scalability of network operations. This section will cover the basics of using Ansible for network automation, including handling various types of network devices, using Ansible modules designed for network tasks, and examples of network automation playbooks.

#### Overview of Network Automation

Network automation involves using software to automate the management, configuration, testing, deployment, and operations of physical and virtual devices within a network. With Ansible, network engineers can automate repetitive tasks, deploy configurations to multiple devices simultaneously, and manage changes more efficiently.

#### Using Ansible with Network Devices

Ansible communicates with network devices using SSH or APIs, depending on the device and module. Unlike managing servers, where Ansible typically executes commands directly on the managed node, network modules often send commands to devices over a network connection.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Connection Types**: Ansible uses different connection types for network devices, such as `network_cli`, `netconf`, and `httpapi`, depending on the device and required tasks.
- **Provider Parameter**: Earlier versions of Ansible network modules required a `provider` parameter to specify connection details. This approach is deprecated in favor of specifying connection details in the inventory or using Ansible's `network_cli` plugin.

#### Network Modules

Ansible includes a wide range of modules tailored for network device management, covering various platforms like Cisco (IOS, IOS XR, NX-OS), Juniper (JunOS), Arista (EOS), and more.

- **Modules Example**: `ios_command` (executes commands on IOS devices), `nxos_vlan` (manages VLANs on NX-OS devices), `junos_config` (manages configuration on JunOS devices).

#### Example of Network Automation Playbook

Here's a simple example of an Ansible playbook that uses the `ios_command` module to retrieve the configuration of a Cisco IOS device:

```yaml
---
- name: Collect Cisco IOS device configuration
  hosts: cisco_routers
  gather_facts: false
  connection: network_cli
  
  tasks:
    - name: Show running configuration
      cisco.ios.ios_command:
        commands: show running-config
      register: output

    - name: Display the configuration
      debug:
        msg: "{{ output.stdout_lines }}"
```

In this playbook:

- `hosts: cisco_routers` specifies that the playbook runs on hosts in the `cisco_routers` group.
- `gather_facts: false` disables gathering system facts since it's not applicable to network devices.
- `connection: network_cli` tells Ansible to use the network CLI connection type.
- The `cisco.ios.ios_command` module executes a command on the IOS device and registers the output.
- The `debug` task prints the output of the command.

#### Best Practices for Network Automation

- **Inventory Management**: Use Ansible's inventory to organize network devices by groups, such as device type or function, to simplify playbook execution.
- **Modular Design**: Leverage roles and include files to create modular, reusable code for different network tasks.
- **Version Control**: Store playbooks and roles in a version control system to track changes and collaborate with others.
- **Continuous Integration**: Implement continuous integration (CI) processes to test network changes in a lab environment before deploying to production.

Network automation with Ansible can significantly reduce manual efforts, minimize configuration errors, and improve the reliability and consistency of network operations. By leveraging Ansible's capabilities, network engineers can focus on more strategic tasks while ensuring that the network is efficiently managed and configured.
