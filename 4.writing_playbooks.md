# 4. Writing Ansible Playbooks

#### YAML Syntax

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization standard that Ansible uses for its playbook syntax. Understanding YAML syntax is crucial for writing effective Ansible playbooks.

- YAML is case sensitive.
- Uses indentation to represent hierarchy (typically 2 spaces per indent level).
- Lists are created using a dash (`-`) followed by a space.
- Dictionaries (key-value pairs) are represented by `key: value` pairs.

Example of YAML syntax:

```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
  tasks:
  - name: Ensure nginx is installed
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: nginx
      state: present
```

#### Basic Playbook Structure

A playbook is a list of plays. A play is a mapping between a set of hosts and the tasks that should be run on those hosts.

- **hosts**: Specifies the hosts or group of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate.
- **vars**: Defines variables for use in the playbook.
- **tasks**: Lists the tasks to be executed.

Example playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure webserver with nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes  # Use privilege escalation
  vars:
    server_port: 80
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: nginx
        state: latest

    - name: Start nginx
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

#### Tasks, Handlers, and Tags

- **Tasks**: The most fundamental block of a playbook, defining what action to perform on the host.
- **Handlers**: Special tasks that only run when notified by another task. Typically used for restarting services.
- **Tags**: Allow you to run specific parts of a playbook without running the whole playbook.

Example of tasks and handlers:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure webserver
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: nginx
        state: latest
      notify: restart nginx

  handlers:
    - name: restart nginx
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
        enabled: yes
```

#### Variables and Facts

Variables in Ansible are used to manage differences between systems. Facts are a type of variable that Ansible gathers from the managed hosts.

Example using variables:

```yaml
---
- name: Install and start Apache
  hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
  tasks:
    - name: Install apache
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start apache service
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes
      when: ansible_facts['distribution'] == 'CentOS'
```

#### Loops and Conditionals

Loops allow you to repeat a task for each item in a list. Conditionals let you execute tasks based on conditions.

Example of a loop:

```yaml
---
- name: Add several users
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Add users
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
        groups: "wheel"
      loop:
        - alice
        - bob
```

Example of conditionals:

```yaml
---
- name: Start a service on a particular distribution
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Start nginx
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"
```

## Verifying Playbooks

### Verifying Ansible Playbooks

Verifying Ansible playbooks is an essential part of the playbook development process. It ensures that your playbooks are syntactically correct, adhere to best practices, and behave as expected across all target systems. This section will cover techniques and tools for verifying Ansible playbooks, including syntax checking, dry-run execution, the use of `ansible-lint`, and testing with Molecule.

#### Syntax Checking

Before running a playbook for real, you can check its syntax to ensure it's syntactically correct. Ansible provides a built-in option for this purpose.

- **Command**:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook --syntax-check playbook.yml
  ```

This command parses your playbook and reports any syntax errors. It's a quick way to catch typos and basic errors in your playbook structure.

#### Dry-Run Execution (Check Mode)

Ansible's check mode allows you to run your playbooks in a "dry run" mode, showing what changes would be made without actually applying them. This is useful for verifying the logic of your playbooks.

- **Command**:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook --check playbook.yml
  ```

Note that check mode relies on modules supporting it. Some tasks may not report correctly if the module does not support dry-run operations.

#### Using `ansible-lint`

`ansible-lint` is a tool that analyzes your playbooks and roles for various issues, such as deviations from best practices, potential errors in execution, and usage of deprecated syntax.

- **Installation**:

  ```bash
  pip install ansible-lint
  ```

- **Usage**:

  ```bash
  ansible-lint playbook.yml
  ```

`ansible-lint` will provide a report of issues found, which you can then fix to improve the quality and reliability of your playbooks.

#### Testing with Molecule

Molecule provides a framework for testing Ansible roles with various backends, such as Docker, Vagrant, or full cloud environments. It allows for extensive testing, including linting, syntax checks, unit tests, and functional testing of roles.

- **Installation**:

  ```bash
  pip install "molecule[docker]"
  ```

- **Usage**:
  To initialize a new role with Molecule and start testing:

  ```bash
  molecule init role my-new-role
  cd my-new-role
  molecule test
  ```

Molecule runs through a series of steps to verify the role, including linting, creating instances, applying the role, verifying the role's effects, and cleaning up. It's a powerful tool for developing and testing Ansible roles in a repeatable and isolated environment.

#### Best Practices for Playbook Verification

- **Iterative Development**: Start with simple playbooks, verify them, and then gradually add complexity. This approach helps in isolating issues.
- **Version Control**: Use version control systems like Git to manage changes to your playbooks. This allows you to track changes, revert if necessary, and collaborate more effectively.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Integrate playbook verification into your CI/CD pipeline. Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI can automatically run syntax checks, `ansible-lint`, and Molecule tests on every commit.

By incorporating these verification techniques into your Ansible playbook development workflow, you can significantly reduce errors, improve playbook quality, and ensure your automation is reliable and maintainable.
